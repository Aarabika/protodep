protodep
=======

Dependency tool for Protocol Buffers IDL file (.proto) vendoring tool.


### Motivation

In building Microservices architecture, gRPC with Protocol Buffers is effective. When using gRPC, your application will depend on many remote services.

If you manage proto files in a git repository, what will you do? Most remote services are managed by git and they will be versioned. We need to control which dependency service version that application uses.


### Install

```bash
$ go get github.com/stormcat24/protodep
```

### Usage

#### protodep.toml

Proto dependency management is defined in `protodep.toml`.

```Ruby
proto_outdir = "./proto"

[[dependencies]]
  target = "github.com/openfresh/plasma/protobuf"
  branch = "master"

[[dependencies]]
  target = "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/examples/examplepb"
  revision = "v1.2.2"
```

#### protodep up

In same directory, execute this command.

```bash
$ protodep up
```

If succeeded, `protodep.lock` is generated.

#### protodep up -f (force update)

Even if protodep.lock exists, you can force update dependenies.

```bash
$ protodep up -f
```
